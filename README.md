### Hey there! 👋

I'm Ravi, a data analyst based in India.

I'm currently learning and building my skills from scratch. If a question pops into my head about a dataset, chances are I'll explore it, analyze it, and share what I find.

My main tech stack is Python, SQL, Excel and PowerBI

I've built a handful of public repos so far, but privately? Way more experiments and notebooks. Goal: 50+ projects by next year!

If you want to follow my learning journey or get tips on starting in data analytics, feel free to connect — I'm happy to share resources!

Fun Facts:
- I love coffee and puzzles
- I don't like 
- Favorite way to unwind is watching anime
- Hobbies: anime, gym, building things

Currently learning: Rust
