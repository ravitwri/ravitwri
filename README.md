## Hi there 👋

I'm Ravi, an aspiring data analyst passionate about turning data into actionable insights.

I'm currently learning and building my skills from scratch. Every day, I'm diving deeper into data, and if a question pops into my head about a dataset, chances are I'll explore it, analyze it, and share what I find.

My main tech stack right now:
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- SQL
- Excel / Google Sheets
- PowrBI

I've got a few learning projects pinned (and more in progress), but my favorites so far are [mention 1-2 if you have, e.g., "my sales data dashboard" or "exploratory analysis on movie datasets"]. I'm always adding new ones as I learn.

I've built a handful of public repos so far, but privately? Way more experiments and notebooks. Goal: 50+ projects by next year!

If you want to follow my learning journey or get tips on starting in data analytics, feel free to connect — I'm happy to share resources!
